# Memory Game
Test your memory recall with this simple game of matching pairs of cards with images.

## How to Play the Game
To see if you have the memory of an elephant or a goldfish, go under 'Environments' and select GitHub pages deployment to launch the game in a separate browser tab.

*Fun fact: These images were made by me and include original character designs. And some nerdy designs for well-known games people play.*
